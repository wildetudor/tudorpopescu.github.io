***Teaching philosophy***
* Appeal to intuition: find examples that students would know&care about and are thus motivated to make parallels to
* Continuously prompt students to get engaged, to leave no-one behind
* For mixed-background classes, assume little specialised knowledge, and instead find bridging points between disciplines
* Instil a sense of step-by-step discovery, with minimal hand-holding
* Make constant references to "real" research: publications, the review process, research groups
* Encourage exchange of ideas and constructive feedback between students, within and between classes
* Clarity and transparency with respect to course requirements and examinations
