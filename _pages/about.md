I am an Oxford graduate with a passion for science and for music. I am presently a postdoc at the University of Vienna, where I investigate comparatively the brain bases of our capacity for music and language.


The overarching question of my research is: How does meaning, and in particular, emotion, emerge between music's different levels - from the individual notes' spectra, all the way to the syntactic abstractions required for the comprehension of large-scale musical form? 

In testing theories on music's perception, production, and cultural evolution, I try to apply the quantitative insights afforded by neuropsychology, neuroimaging, and data science, to what we know from musicology, music theory, and linguistics.

Even more broadly, I am interested in how the sum of our perceptual predispositions and cognitive biases gives rise to culturally-transmitted behaviours such as music and language; and in these behaviours' underlying neuronal workings.


My research has been published, among others, in [*Science*](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/366/6468/944), [*Cortex*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010945218303356?via%3Dihub), [*Neuropsychologia*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0028393215302682), [*Scientific Reports*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-35873-8), and [*Behavioral and Brain Sciences*](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioral-and-brain-sciences/article/dynamic-hierarchical-cognition-music-and-language-demand-further-types-of-abstracta/2A06A50DAF15EBCC9918B86715178E01); as well as featured in media channels such as the [**BBC**](http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_9687000/9687032.stm) and the [**Ã–RF**](https://science.orf.at/v2/stories/2994714/).
